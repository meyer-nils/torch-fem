# About

*torch-fem* is a GPU-accelerated Finite Element Method (FEM) library built on PyTorch. By leveraging PyTorch’s automatic differentiation, it enables seamless sensitivity analysis and gradient-based optimization for structural mechanics, allowing you to treat FEM solvers as differentiable layers in your machine learning or optimization workflows.

**Highlights**

- ⚙️ Support for many element types with linear and quadratic interpolation  
- 🧱 Built-in material models from linear elasticity to finite-strain hyperelasticity  
- 📈 GPU acceleration via PyTorch (and optional CuPy support)  
- 🔁 Differentiable solvers enabling end-to-end gradient-based optimization  
- 📓 Rich examples - from basic cantilevers to topology optimization notebooks
